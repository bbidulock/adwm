Release adwm-0.7.16 released 2022-01-28
---------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.7.16

0.7.16          Maintenance Release 0.7.16

    This is another release of the adwm window manager that provides a
    fully XDG, WindowMaker, WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCM 2.0
    compliant tiling/floating window manager. It borrows concepts from
    dwm(1), velox(1), awesome(1), spectrwm(1) and wmii(1).

    This is a maintenance release that corrects and supplements some key
    bindings: removes a conflict, uses preferred applications (thanks to
    xdg-launch), provides controls for microphone volume and muting, and
    switches scroll-wheel bindings on the root window (this was really
    bothering me). Consistent build flags and support for GCC 11.1.0 is
    also provided. Session management has not progressed since the last
    release. There are no outstanding issues at the time of release, and
    the next release should include some outstanding development from the
    TODO list.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
