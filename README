adwm
===============

Package `adwm-0.7.14.3` was released under GPLv3 license
2021-12-09.

This was originally a fork of Echinus which in turn was a fork of `dwm(1)`,
and borrows concepts from `velox(1)`, `awesome(1)`, `spectrwm(1)` and
`wmii(1)`.  What it includes is a full rewrite with significant updates and
additions resulting in full EWMH (NetwM), WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif),
ICCCM 2.0 compliance and support.

The source for `adwm` is hosted on [GitHub][1].


Release
-------

This is the `adwm-0.7.14.3` package, released 2021-12-09.
This release, and the latest version, can be obtained from [GitHub][1],
using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/adwm.git

Please see the [RELEASE][3] and [NEWS][4] files for release notes and
history of user visible changes for the current version, and the
[ChangeLog][5] file for a more detailed history of implementation
changes.  The [TODO][6] file lists features not yet implemented and
other outstanding items.

The file [COMPLIANCE][7] lists the current state of EWMH/ICCCM compliance.

Please see the [INSTALL][8] file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)`, please use this file.  An abbreviated
installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

that can be found in the file [LICENSE][9].  As over 90% of the source file
lines have been supplied or replaced and the remaining 10% is not subject

file [COPYING][10].


Quick Start
-----------

The quickest and easiest way to get `adwm` up and
running is to run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/adwm.git
    $> cd adwm
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install `adwm` the
quickest.  For those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading
`./configure --help`, some compile time options can be turned on and off
before the build.

For general information on GNU's `./configure`, see the file
[INSTALL][8].

Dependencies
------------

Install the following X Libraries to build and load `adwm`:

- `libxft`
- `libxrandr`
- `libxinerama`
- `libxpm`
- `startup-notification`
- `libxcomposite`
- `libxdamage`
- `libpng`

To support default key and mouse bindings, build and install the
following packages:

- [xdg-launch][11]: for application launching default key bindings
- [xde-ctools][12]: for `xde-run`, `xde-winmenu`, `xde-winlist` and
  `xde-wkspmenu` default bindings
- [xde-menu][13]: for `xde-menu` root menu default bindings
- [xde-session][14]: for `xde-logout` and `xde-xlock` default bindings

To support default key bindings, the following applications must be
installed:

- `uxterm`: to be able to launch a terminal at all
- `roxterm`: for terminal application launching
- `firefox`: for browser application launching
- `pcmanfm`: for file manager application launching
- `gvim`: for editor application launching
- `scrot`: to support screenshot key bindings
- `xbrightness` and `xbacklight` or `acpibacklight`: to support
  brightness keys
- `amixer`: to support audio control keys
- `xrandr`: to support screen rotation key bindings

For a more full-featured desktop environment, build and install the
following packages:

- [xde-styles][17]: for a small, consistent set of styles for ADWM and
  other light-weight window managers
- [xde-panel][15]: for a panel that works well with ADWM
- [xde-applets][16]: for various WindowMaker dock applications and systray
  applets
- [xde-theme][18]: for various desktop themes and theme packs
- [xde-sounds][19]: for base sound themes

Of course for a minimal desktop, lemon-bar and dmenu will suffice
([xde-menu][13] supports a version of dmenu that supports
freedesktop.org desktop files).
