Quick Start:
------------

The quickest and easiest way to get adwm up and running is to run
the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/adwm.git adwm
    $> cd adwm
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install adwm the quickest.  For
those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help,
some compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.
adwm, however, does not provide any compile time options of its
own.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file `INSTALL'.

Running adwm
-----------------

Read the manual page after installation: man adwm.
