@PACKAGE@
===============

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under GPLv3 license @DATE@.

This was originally a fork of Echinus which in turn was a fork of `dwm(1)`, and
borrows concepts from `velox(1)`, `awesome(1)`, `spectrwm(1)` and `wmii(1)`.
The source for `@PACKAGE@` is hosted on [GitHub][1].  What it includes is a full
rewrite with significant updates and additions resulting in full EWMH (NetwM),
WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCCM 2.0 compliance and support.
