@PACKAGE@
===============

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under GPLv3 license

This was originally a fork of Echinus which in turn was a fork of `dwm(1)`,
and borrows concepts from `velox(1)`, `awesome(1)`, `spectrwm(1)` and
`wmii(1)`.  What it includes is a full rewrite with significant updates and
additions resulting in full EWMH (NetwM), WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif),
ICCCM 2.0 compliance and support.

The source for `@PACKAGE@` is hosted on [GitHub][1].
