===============

This was originally a fork of Echinus which in turn was a fork of `dwm(1)`, and

for __`@PACKAGE@`__ is hosted on [GitHub][1].  What it includes is a full
rewrite with significant updates and additions resulting in full EWMH (NetwM),
WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCCM 2.0 compliance and support.
