Maintenance Release 0.7.16
==========================

This is another release of the adwm window manager that provides a fully
XDG, WindowMaker, WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCM 2.0 compliant
tiling/floating window manager.  It borrows concepts from `dwm(1)`,
`velox(1)`, `awesome(1)`, `spectrwm(1)` and `wmii(1)`.

This is a maintenance release that corrects and supplements some key
bindings: removes a conflict, uses preferred applications (thanks to
xdg-launch), provides controls for microphone volume and muting, and
switches scroll-wheel bindings on the root window (this was really
bothering me).  Consistent build flags and support for GCC 11.1.0 is
also provided.  Session management has not progressed since the last
release.  There are no outstanding issues at the time of release, and
the next release should include some outstanding development from the
[TODO](TODO) list.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/adwm/issues).
