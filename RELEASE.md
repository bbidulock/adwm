Maintenance Release 0.7.8
=========================

This is another release of the adwm window manager that provdes a fully
XDG, WindowMaker, WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCM 2.0 compliant
tiling/floating window manager.  It borrows concepts from `dwm(1)`,
`velox(1)`, `awesome(1)`, `spectrwm(1)` and `wmii(1)`.

This is a maintenance release that includes some build improvements and
provides a better workaround for gcc 9.1's silly string truncation
warnings.  There are no outstanding issues at the time of release, and
the next release should include some outstanding development from the
[TODO](TODO) list.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/adwm/issues).
