Internal layout mechanism:

      and vim modes
* [ ] apply tree format to floating windows and floating window placement.

Session control:

* [x] fixup restart behaviour
* [ ] add session management
* [ ] implement separate file for dock app list.
* [ ] implement function to save dock app list.
* [ ] do not load all resources on reload (only those that are cannot
      be changed by the user after startup.

Behaviour:

* [x] showing desktop mode in fluxbox(1) is per desktop, we should do
      the same and make showing desktop mode only apply to a view.

* [x] when resizing windows frame is resizing faster than the client
      (due to synchronization).  Change resizing behaviour to not resize
      the frame until the client responds to the resize request.
      (Not sure I want to do this one: current behaviour is ok.)

* [x] implement lhalf and rhalf button functions.
* [x] switch to lhalf or rhalf at screen/monitor edges (no _Ctrl_).
* [x] defeat snap when moving with _Ctrl_ key.
* [x] fix snapping while moving
* [x] fix snapping while resizing

      button.
* [ ] fix broken rollup function (maybe using XShape).
* [x] fix broken key chains.

* [ ] get keyboard-based resize working
* [ ] support _NET_WM_FULL_PLACEMENT
* [ ] support _NET_WM_OPAQUE_REGION
* [ ] support _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR

Configuration:

* [ ] Provide external mechanism for setting configuration items.
      Possibly use manager selection: do not set property on the
      conversion window when getting the configuration item; set
      the property on the conversion window to set the
      configuration item.
      Another possibility is to use RESOURCE_MANAGER.
* [ ] Provide external mechanism for invoking keyboard actions:
      at least those that are not supported by EWMH and other
      extensions.
      Possibly use client message with action id and up to 4
      parameters.
* [ ] Provide external mechanism for redefining key bindings.
* [x] Make mouse button action bindings configurable.
* [ ] Have default key bindings invoke xde-preferred for default
      terminal, browser, file manager and editor.
* [ ] Consider using xde-preferred for screenshot, brighness and
      backlight controls, and audio controls.  Either have defined
      defaults, or use smart scripts (debian way) to find something
      usable.
