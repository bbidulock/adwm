.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a light-weight, re-parenting, dynamic tiling/stacking window manager,
intended on being fully controllable using only the keyboard: the
objective of all dynamic tiling window managers.  However,
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
also supports multiple views, different layout formats per view, and
Window Maker dock application dock.
.Pp
Many light-weight window managers support a dock:
.Xr blackbox 1 ,
.Xr fluxbox 1 ,
.Xr openbox 1 ,
.Xr pekwm 1 ,
.Xr wmaker 1 ;
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
is no exception.
The application dock can be customized using dock theme elements.
.Pp
Dock elements differ from other style and theme elements (see
.Xr adwm-style 5
and
.Xr adwm-theme 5 Ns ).
Although dock elements are theme elements, they also contain state
information about the state of the dock and the ordering of dock
applications within the dock.  Therefore, it is maintained as a separate
file that can be separately written to the user directory to save state.
.Pp
To control the theme of the dock,
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
supports customizable dock theme elements.  Customizable dock theme elements are
defined in an X Resource formatted configuration file.  Dock theme elements
can either be part of the main configuration file, or they can be
included or referenced from the main configuration file.  It is typical
to place the dock theme elements in a file named
.Pa dockrc
in the same directory as the
.Pa themerc
configuration file that references or includes it.
See
.Sx FILES ,
below.
.Sh SYNTAX
The general syntax of style and theme elements, as specified directly in
the
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
resource file, is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm element Ns Li : Ar <value>
.Pp
Where the fields are defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm element
One of the elements described under
.Sx ELEMENTS .
.It Ar <value> Li = Li { Ns Ar <pixmap> Ns Li | Ns Ar <font> Ns Li | Ns Ar <color> Ns Li | Ns Ar <number> Ns Li | Ns Ar <string> Ns Li | Ns Ar <bool> Ns Li }
The value depends on the element that is specified.  Typically the
value is a path and name of a pixmap file, an X11 true-type or
bitmapped font specification, an X11 color specification, a number, a
string, a boolean, or a specially formatted value as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXX"
.It Ar <pixmap>
Pixmaps are specified with a full or relative path and file name.  When
the path is relative, it is relative to the directory in which the
dock file resides.
Pixmaps can be formatted as
.Pa .xbm
or
.Pa .xpm
files.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm button.iconify.pixmap Ns Li : Pa pixmaps/min_focused.xpm
.It Ar <font>
Fonts are specified with an Fontconfig pattern string or an X Logical
Font Description (XFLD) formatted font specification string.  See
.Xr FcParseName 3
and
.Xr xft 3 .
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm normal.font Ns Li : Ar "Liberation Sans:size=9:medium"
.It Ar <color>
Colors are specified as X resource colors.  This can be a color name or
color specification.  For the possible format of colors, see
.Xr XParseColor 3 .
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm selected.shadow Ns Li : Ar #394870
.It Ar <number>
A decimal number.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm title Ns Li : Ar 15
.It Ar <string>
A specially formatted string as specified by the element definition.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm titlelayout Ns Li : Ar "EFASLN  RIMC"
.It Ar <bool>
A boolean value taking either zero (0) or one (1) as an argument.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dectiled Ns Li : Ar 0
.El
.El
.Sh ELEMENTS
.Pp
The theme elements are defined below.  Each heading provides the
format of the command resource (without the
.Li \(lqAdwm*\(rq
portion) and the possible arguments for each element, in accordance
with the element syntax described above under
.Sx SYNTAX .
.Ss STRUT THEME ELEMENTS
Struts are fixed size and position,
.Dq sticky
windows that occupy the edge of the monitor.  They typically contain
panels, docks, clips, system trays or other persistent desktop features.
To customize the behaviour of these specialized windows,
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
provides several strut theme elements that customize their behaviour.
.Pp
These directives can be contained in the main configuration file (see
.Xr @PACKAGE@-config 5 Ns ),
the theme configuration file (see
.Xr @PACKAGE@-theme 5 Ns ),
or the dock configuration file.  Historically, they were contained in
the main configuration file,
.Pa adwmrc ;
however, currently they are typically contained in the theme
configuration file,
.Pa themerc .
See
.Xr @PACKAGE@-theme 5 .
The reason for this is that the strut theme elements do not contain
dynamic state information, whereas the
.Pa dockrc
file does.
.Pp
The defined strut theme elements are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm hidebastards Ar <number>
Specifies whether to lower bastards, hide bastards (remove struts) or
turn struts off when struts are toggled.  This is only in effect when
struts are disabled.
The
.Ar <number>
value can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar 2 Li - Ic StrutsDown" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar 0 Li - Ic StrutsOff
Turn struts and dock off: marginalize unless selected.
.It Ar 1 Li - Ic StrutsHide
Hide struts and dock (remove from display).
.It Ar 2 Li - Ic StrutsDown
Struts and dock off: lower to bottom unless selected.
.El
.Pp
The default value is zero (0): that is, turn struts off rather
than hiding them.
.Pp
Applications with struts are dock and panel applications that
occupy the edge of the screen.  When struts are on, these
applications occupy their reserved area and the work area on
the screen is reduced.  When struts are off, these
applications occupy the edge of the screen; but, the work area
is not reduced.  When struts are hidden, the work area of the
screen is not reduced; however, the applications owning the
struts are not displayed.
.Pp
This directive affects primarily the response to the
.Cm struts
key binding as described in
.Xr @PACKAGE@-keys 5 .
Setting this value to true has the effect of applying or
removing struts; whereas, the value of false, provides for
exposing and hiding struts.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm hidebastards Ns Li : Ar 2
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm strutsactive Ar <bool>
Specifies whether struts (panels and dock) should default to
shown or hidden.
The
.Ar <bool>
value can be zero (0), indicating false, or non-zero (1),
indicating true.
When true, struts default to shown; false, hidden.
The default value is one (1): that is, struts are shown by default.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm strutsactive Ns Li : Ar 0
.Pp
.Sy Note:
this setting only affects the default for views.  The actual
setting for a particular view can be altered using the
.Cm struts
key binding as described in
.Xr @PACKAGE@-keys 5 .
.El
.Ss DOCK THEME ELEMENTS
The dock is an area that contains Window Maker dock
applications.
The following directives specify the position and orientation
of the dock.
.Pp
These directives can be contained in the main configuration file (see
.Xr @PACKAGE@-config 5 Ns ),
the theme configuration file (see
.Xr @PACKAGE@-theme 5 Ns ),
or the dock configuration file.  Historically, they were contained in
the main configuration file,
.Pa adwmrc ;
however, currently they are typically contained in the theme
configuration file,
.Pa themerc .
See
.Xr @PACKAGE@-theme 5 .
The reason for this is that the dock theme elements for position and
orientation do not contain dynamic state information, whereas the
.Pa dockrc
file does.
.Pp
The dock theme elements for orientation and position are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.position Ar <position>
Specifies the position of the dock on the screen.
The argument,
.Ar <position> ,
is an integer value that can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar DockSouthWest(0)" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar "DockNone(0)"
default (same as
.Ar "DockEast(1)" Ns );
.It Ar "DockEast(1)"
centered right on the screen;
.It Ar "DockNorthEast(2)"
top right on the screen;
.It Ar "DockNorth(3)"
centered top on the screen;
.It Ar "DockNorthWest(4)"
top left on the screen;
.It Ar "DockWest(5)"
centered left on the screen;
.It Ar "DockSouthWest(6)"
bottom left on the screen;
.It Ar "DockSouth(7)"
centered bottom on the screen;
.It Ar "DockSouthEast(9)"
bottom right on the screen.
.El
.Pp
The default value is
.Ar "DockNone(0)" :
that is, the dock is centered on the right of the screen.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dock.position Ns Li : Ar 0
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.orient Ar <orientation>
Specifies the orientation of the dock on the screen.
The argument,
.Ar "<orientation>" ,
is an integer value that can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar DockVert(1)" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar DockHorz(0)
the dock is filled horizontally;
.It Ar DockVert(1)
the dock is filled vertically.
.El
.Pp
The default value is chosen based on
.Cm "dock.position" ,
and is chosen so that the dock extends along the edge of the
screen.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dock.orient Ns Li : Ar 1
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.monitor Ar <monitor>
Specifies the monitor (in a multi-head setup) that will be
used to contain the dock.  The argument,
.Ar <monitor> ,
is a value between zero (0) and the number of monitors
(inclusive).
.Pp
The special value zero (0) indicates that the
monitor for the dock should be automatically chosen based on
.Cm "dock.position" .
When chosen automatically, the monitor selected for the dock
will be the monitor closest to the dock position on the
screen.
The other values indicate the monitor number of the monitor
that should contain the dock.
.Pp
The default value is zero (0): that is, the dock monitor is
chosen automatically.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dock.monitor Ns Li : Ar 0
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.app<n> Ar "<res_name> <res_class> <wm_command>"
Specifies the relative position of dock applications in the
dock.
Dock applications with a value of
.Cm <n>
that is lower are placed earlier in the dock; higher, placed
later.
The arguments (separated by a single space) are interpreted as
follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar <wm_command>" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar "<res_name>"
resource name in
.Cm "WM_CLASS"
property;
.It Ar "<res_class>"
resource class in
.Cm "WM_CLASS"
property;
.It Ar "<wm_command>"
command in
.Cm "WM_COMMAND"
property.
.El
.Pp
Example:
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app0 Ns Li : Ar " wmclockmon DockApp wmclockmon"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app1 Ns Li : Ar " wmblob DockApp wmblob"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app2 Ns Li : Ar " wmnd wmnd wmnd"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app3 Ns Li : Ar " wmcore wmcore wmcore"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app4 Ns Li : Ar " wmcpuload DockApp wmcpuload"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app5 Ns Li : Ar " wmtimer wmtimer wmtimer"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app6 Ns Li : Ar " wmsysmon wmsysmon wmsysmon"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app7 Ns Li : Ar " wmtimer wmtimer wmtimer"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app8 Ns Li : Ar " wmbubble wmbubble wmbubble"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app9 Ns Li : Ar " wmmixer WMMixer wmmixer"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app10 Ns Li : Ar "wmnet WMNET wmnet"
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm dock.app11 Ns Li : Ar "wmCalClock wmCalClock wmCalClock"
.Pp
.Sy Note:
Although initial positions can be specified in a configuration file, the
user is able to move dock applications around after they have been
mapped using the mouse.  The user is also able to save the modified
configuration to the
.Cm dockFile .
This means that the
.Cm dockFile
must be writable by the user and must, therefore, be located in a user
configuration directory.  The modified configuration can be applied
either to all themes, or just to the active theme.  This is determined
by the location to which the file is written (either to an un-themed
directory or a themed directory).
.Pp
.Sy Note:
No defaults are provided in the default
.Pa @PACKAGE@rc
file.  These resources, if defined at all, should likely be defined in the
.Pa styleFile
associated with the current style, as it is a themeable item.
.El
.Ss DOCK STYLE ELEMENTS
The dock also uses several style elements from the
.Pa styleFile
for providing the decorative tile for the dock applications.  These
styles are normally specified in the
.Pa styleFile
rather than in the
.Pa dockFile
because they are colors and textures that are normally part of the
style, regardless of how the dock is themed (see
.Xr @PACKAGE@-style 5 Ns ).
.Sh FILES
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm $(dirname <themeFile>) Ns Ar /dockrc
Default location of the dock file when a theme is defined.
.It Cm $(dirname <styleFile>) Ns Ar /dockrc
Default location of the dock file when a style is defined.
.It Cm ${ADWMPRIVDIR} Ns Ar /dockrc
Location of the user private dock file.
.It Cm ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR} Ns Ar /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
Location of the user runtime dock file.
.It Cm ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME} Ns Ar /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
Location of the user XDG dock file.
.It Cm ${HOME} Ns Ar /.@PACKAGE@/dockrc
Location of the user dock file.
.It Ar @pkgconfdir@/dockrc
Location of the system dock file.
.El
.Pp
Because dock style elements are more thematic, they are usually
contained in a separate
.Pa dockrc
file that is included from the
.Pa themerc
file for a given theme.
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm dockFile Pa <path>
Specifies the path and filename,
.Pa <path> ,
of a file from which to read dock application style elements and dock
application ordering.
The path may be absolute or relative: when relative, the path
is considered relative to the directory which contains the
configuration file in which the declaration resides.
The default is
.Pa dockrc ,
that is, the file named
.Pa dockrc
in the same directory as the main configuration file.
.Pp
The
.Pa dockrc
file is normally placed in the same directory as the
.Pa themerc
file to which it corresponds, or included by that file.  When a
.Pa themerc
file is specified, the file will normally specify or include the
.Pa dockFile
file.
.Pp
When the specified or default
.Pa dockFile
does not exist, directories are searched for one in the following order:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Cm ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR} Ns Pa /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
.It
.Cm ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME} Ns Pa /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
.It
.Cm ${HOME} Ns Pa /.@PACKAGE@/dockrc
.It
.Cm ${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS} Ns Pa /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
.It
.Cm ${XDG_DATA_DIRS} Ns Pa /themes/ Ns Cm <theme.name> Ns Pa /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
.It
.Cm ${XDG_DATA_DIRS} Ns Pa /@PACKAGE@/dockrc
.El
.Pp
Where
.Cm <theme.name>
is the name of the current theme resource.  When the theme name resource
is not defined, paths including
.Cm <theme.name>
are skipped.
When no file can be found, compiled-in defaults are used.
.Pp
See
.Xr @PACKAGE@-theme 5
for more information on how this file is included in a theme.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dockFile Ns Li : Pa dockrc
.El
.Sh COMPLIANCE
.Pp
In general the strut behavior features described above will fight with
external panels, docks, system trays and other elements that are set for
.Dq auto-hide
or
.Dq variable width
behaviour.  It is best to turn these features off when using external
panels with
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@ .

.Sh HISTORY
.Cm @PACKAGE@
configuration began with the simple X Resource scheme
provided by
.Xr echinus 1
and quickly grew from there to support the advanced features
of
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@ .
The same basic X Resource scheme is supported and an
.Xr echinus 1
resource file will work with
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
(substituting
.Ic Adwm*
for
.Ic Echinus* Ns ).
