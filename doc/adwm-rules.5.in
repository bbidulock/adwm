.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a light-weight, reparenting, dynamic tiling/stacking window
manager intended on being fully controllable using only the
keyboard: the objective of all dynamic tiling window managers.
.Pp
However, some clients are not well-behaved under tiling modes (or,
sometimes, even under floating modes).  Therefore, it is sometimes
necessary to override the default behaviour of the window manager to
accommodate these poorly behaved clients.
.Pp
A number of window managers (e.g.
.Xr icewm 1 Ns ),
support overriding the behavior of clients specified by resource name
and class to accommodate poorly behaved clients, or just to allow user
preferences.
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
also supports this using window rules.
Window rules describe rules that may be applied to newly managed windows
to alter their behavior (primarily for tiled layouts).  Their purpose is
to address clients that are not well-behaved with dynamic window
managers.
.Pp
Window rules are defined in an X Resource formatted configuration file.
Window rules can either be part of the main configuration file, or they
can be included or referenced from the main configuration file: see
.Cm ruleFile
directive in
.Xr @PACKAGE@-config 5 .
It is typical to place the window rules in a file named
.Pa rulerc
in the same directory as the main configuration file (e.g. in the
.Pa "~/.@PACKAGE@/rulerc"
file).  See
.Sx FILES ,
below.
.Sh SYNTAX
.Pp
The general syntax of window rule commands, as specified directly in the
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
resource file, is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule<n>.<criteria> Ns Li : Ar <regex>
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule<n>.<settings> Ns Li : Ar <value>
.Pp
where the fields are defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm rule<n>
Specifies a rule, where
.Cm <n>
is the number of the rule, which can be an integer between zero (0) and
sixty-three (63) inclusive.  That is, there can be a maximum of 64 rules defined.
.It Cm <criteria> Ns Li : Ar <regex>
One of the criteria (regular expressions), described under
.Sx CRITERIA ,
below.
.It Cm <settings> Ns Li : Ar <value>
One of the settings to override, described under
.Sx SETTINGS ,
below.
.El
.Ss CRITERIA
Criteria for window rules are extended regular expressions that match
some property of the client.  There are several criteria that may be
specified.  At least one criteria must be specified for the rule to be
effective.  The available criteria are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm prop Ns Li : Ar <propregex>
A extended regular expression meant to match the 3-tuple of resource
class, resource name, and window role (that are separated by colons
(":"):
.Pp
.Li Ar <res_class> Ns Li : Ns Ar <res_name> Ns Li : Ns Ar <role>
.Pp
where the components of the 3-tuple are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar <res_class>" -compact
.It Ar <res_class>
Contains the resource class from the
.Cm WM_CLASS
property on the client, or a zero-length string when not present.
.Pp
.It Ar <res_name>
Contains the resource name from the
.Cm WM_CLASS
property on the client, or a zero-length string when not present.
.Pp
.It Ar <res_role>
Contains the window role from the
.Cm WM_WINDOW_ROLE
property on the client, or, when
.Cm WM_WINDOW_ROLE
is not present, the name from the initial
.Cm WM_NAME
property on the client, or a zero-length string when neither are
present.
.El
.Pp
The special sequence,
.Cm NULL ,
can be used to skip this regular expression in the old format.
.El
.Pp
All specified criteria must match for the rule to be considered and the
corresponding settings applied.
.Ss SETTINGS
Settings specify which behaviors to change and override when the
specified criteria for the rule matches.  Settings can alter almost all
of the automatic behavior of the window manager with regard to the
specific client.  Settings are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Li Cm <feature> Ns Li [ Ns Cm .<field> Ns Li ] Ns Li : Ar <value>
.Pp
where the features are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm tags Ns Li : Ar <tagsregex>
Specifies on which tags (views/desktops) the client should appear.
.Ar <tagsregex>
is an extended regular expression specifying on which tags
(views/workspaces) the client should appear.  The client will appear on
all tags (views/workspaces) whose name matches the regular expression.
.It Cm is.<field> Ns Li : Ar <value>
Specifies the state of the client.
.Ar <value>
is an integer truth value specifying false when zero (0); true,
non-zero.
.Cm <field>
can be one of the followings, specifying the client is to start:
.Pp

.El
.It Cm has.<field> Ns Li : Ar <value>
Specifies decorations that the client should display.
.Ar <value>

non-zero.

can be one of the following, specifying client decorations:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm border" -compact
.It Cm title
title bar;
.It Cm grips
resize grips;
.It Cm border

will not be displayed when a title bar is not displayed.  Also, buttons
that correspond to disallowed actions may not be sensitive.

.Ss OLD SYNTAX
.Pp
Window rules used to have an older format that is now deprecated.
.Nm @PACKAGE@
still supports this syntax; however, it has some restriction.  The old
syntax was as follows:
.Pp
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule<n> Ns Li : Ar "<propregex> <tagsregex> <isfloating> <hastitle>"
.Pp
where the fields were defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Ar <propregex>
This field was defined as for the current format (see
.Sx CRITERIA ,
above); however, because
it is specified with other expressions in the same resource, the
extended regular expression could not contain interior white space.
.It Ar <tagsregex>
An extended regular expression specifying on which tags
(views/workspaces) the client should appear.  The client will appear on
all tags (views/workspaces) whose name matches the regular expression.
.Pp
This is the equivalent of the current
.Cm tags
setting (see
.Sx SETTINGS ,
above).  However, because it is specified with other expressions in the
same resource, the extended regular express could not contain interior
white space.
Also, the special sequence,
.Cm NULL ,
could be used to skip this regular expression in the old format.
.It Ar <isfloating>
An integer which, when zero (0), indicates false; when non-zero,
true.  When true, the client whose rule this matches will be started
floating, even on tiled layouts.  When false, the client will be started
tiled.
.Pp
This is the equivalent of the current
.Cm is.floater
setting (see
.Sx SETTINGS ,
above).
.It Ar <hastitle>
is an integer which, when zero (0), indicates false, when non-zero,
true.  When true, the client whose rule this matches will not be given a
title bar.  When false, it will be given a title bar.
.Pp
This is equivalent to the equivalent of the current
.Cm has.title
setting (see
.Sx SETTINGS ,
above).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
Following is an example that makes Mplayer float with a title bar,
resize grips by default, using the current syntax:
.Pp
Example:
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule0.prop Ns Li : Ar ^Mplayer:
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule0.is.floater Ns Li : Ar 1
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule0.has.title Ns Li : Ar 1
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule0.has.grips Ns Li : Ar 1
.Pp
Following is an example that makes Mplayer float with a title by
default, using the older syntax:
.Pp
Example:
.Dl Li "Adwm*" Ns Cm rule0 Ns Li : Ar ^Mplayer: NULL 1 1
.Sh DEFAULTS
For the most part,
.Nm @PACKAGE@
does a good job of accommodating most clients.  Therefore, there are no
default rules.
.Sh FILES
Following are the locations of the
.Xr @PACKAGE@-buttons 5
file, in the order in which they are searched:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm "$(dirname <themeFile>)" Ns Ar /rulerc
Default location of the rules file when a theme is defined.
.It Cm "$(dirname <styleFile>)" Ns Ar /rulerc
Default location of the rules file when a style is defined.
.It Cm "${ADWMPRIVDIR}" Ns AAr /rulerc
Location of the user private rules file.
.It Cm "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}" Ns Ar /@PACKAGE@/rulerc
Location of the user runtime rules file.
.It Cm "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}" Ns Ar /@PACKAGE@/rulerc
Location of the user XDG rules file.
.It Cm "${HOME}" Ns Ar /.@PACKAGE@/rulerc
Location of the user rules file.
.It Cm "${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS}" Ns Ar /@PACKAGE@/rulerc
Location of the system XDG file.
.It Ar @pkgconfdir@/rulerc
Location of the default system rulerc file.

.Sh HISTORY
.Pp
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
configuration began with the simple X Resource scheme provided by
.Xr echinus 1
and quickly grew from there to support the advanced features of
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@ .
The same basic X Resource scheme is supported and an
.Xr echinus 1
resource file will work with
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
(substituting
.Cm Adwm*
for
.Cm Echinus* ).
