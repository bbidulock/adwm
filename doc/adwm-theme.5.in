.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a light-weight, re-parenting, dynamic tiling/stacking window manager,
intended on being fully controllable using only the keyboard: the
objective of all dynamic tiling window managers.  However,
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
also supports multiple views, different layout formats per view, and
Window Maker dock application dock.
These aspects of the window manager can be managed using theme elements.
.Pp
Theme elements differ from style style elements (see
.Xr adwm-style 5 Ns ).
Style elements apply to the windows on the desktop, whereas theme
elements apply to the desktop itself and the struts around it.
To control theme elements,
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
supports customizable theme elements.  Customizable theme elements are
defined in an X Resource formatted configuration file.  Themes can
either be part of the main configuration file, or they can be included
or referenced from the main configuration file.  It is typical to palce
the theme elements in a file named
.Pa themerc
in the same directory as the main configuration file (e.g. in the
.Pa ~/.@PACKAGE@/themerc
file).  See
.Sx FILES ,
below.
.Sh SYNTAX
The general syntax of theme elements, as specified directly in
the
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
resource file, is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl Adwm* Ns Cm element Ns Li : Ar <value>
.Pp
Where the fields are defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm element
One of the elements described under
.Sx ELEMENTS .
.It Ar <value> Li = Li { Ns Ar <pixmap> Ns Li | Ns Ar <font> Ns Li | Ns Ar <color> Ns Li | Ns Ar <number> Ns Li | Ns Ar <string> Ns Li | Ns Ar <bool> Ns Li }
The value depends on the element that is specified.  Typically the
value is a path and name of a pixmap file, an X11 true-type or
bitmapped font specification, an X11 color specification, a number, a
string, a boolean, or a specially formatted value as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXXXX"
.It Ar <pixmap>
Pixmaps are specified with a full or relative path and file name.  When
the path is relative, it is relative to the directory in which the
style file resides.
Pixmaps can be formatted as
.Pa .xbm
or
.Pa .xpm
files.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm button.iconify.pixmap Ns Li : Pa pixmaps/min_focused.xpm
.It Ar <font>
Fonts are specified with an Fontconfig pattern string or an X Logical
Font Description (XFLD) formatted font specification string.  See
.Xr FcParseName 3
and
.Xr xft 3 .
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm normal.font Ns Li : Ar "Liberation Sans:size=9:medium"
.It Ar <color>
Colors are specified as X resource colors.  This can be a color name or
color specification.  For the possible format of colors, see
.Xr XParseColor 3 .
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm selected.shadow Ns Li : Ar #394870
.It Ar <number>
A decimal number.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm title Ns Li : Ar 15
.It Ar <string>
A specially formatted string as specified by the element definition.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm titlelayout Ns Li : Ar "EFASLN  RIMC"
.It Ar <bool>
A boolean value taking either zero (0) or one (1) as an argument.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dectiled Ns Li : Ar 0

.Sh ELEMENTS
.Pp
The theme elements are defined below.  Each heading provides the
format of the command resource (without the
.Li \(lqAdwm*\(rq
portion) and the possible arguments for each element, in accordance
with the element syntax described above under
.Sx SYNTAX .
.Ss FILE AND NAME THEME ELEMENTS
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm styleFile Pa <path>
Specifies the path and filename,
.Pa <path> ,
of a file from which to read style elements.
The path may be absolute or relative: when relative, the path
is considered relative to the directory which contains the
configuration file in which the declaration resides.
The default is
.Pa stylerc ,
that is, the file named
.Pa stylerc
in the same directory as the main configuration file.
.Pp
The
.Pa stylerc
file is normally placed in the same directory as the
.Pa themerc
file to which it corresponds, or included by that file.  When a
.Pa themerc
file is specified, the file will normally specify or include the
.Pa styleFile
file.
.Pp
See
.Xr @PACKAGE@-style 5
for more information on the format and contents of this file.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm styleFile Ns Li : Pa stylerc
.It Cm styleName Pa <string>
.It Cm dockFile Pa <path>
Specifies the path and filename,
.Pa <path> ,
of a file from which to read dock application style elements and dock
application ordering.
The path may be absolute or relative: when relative, the path
is considered relative to the directory which contains the
configuration file in which the declaration resides.
The default is
.Pa dockrc ,
that is, the file named
.Pa dockrc
in the same directory as the main configuration file.
.Pp
The
.Pa dockrc
file is normally placed in the same directory as the
.Pa themerc
file to which it corresponds, or included by that file.  When a
.Pa themerc
file is specified, the file will normally specify or include the
.Pa dockFile
file.
.Pp

for more information on the format and contents of this file.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dockFile Ns Li : Pa dockrc
.El
.Ss TAG THEME ELEMENTS
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
has a number of workspace (or
.Dq view ,
historically
.Dq tag Ns )
theme elements, that can be used to theme the work space names, pager
layout, monitor layout, and backgrounds.
.Pp
Because tag theme elements are more thematic, they are usually contained
in a separate
.Pa themerc
file that is included from the
.Pa stylerc
file for a given theme.  That way, the
.Pa stylerc
file can be a symbolic link to a generic style, whereas the local
.Pa themerc
file can contain the theme-specific resources.
.Pp
The tag theme elements are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm tags.number Ar <number>
Specifies the number of tags (i.e. desktops) available.
The default number is five (5).
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm tags.number Ns Li : Ar 7
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm tags.orient Ar <value>
Specifies the orientation of the layout of pagers.
.Ar <value>
is an integer number that may be one of:

.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm tags.start Ar <value>
Specifies the starting corner for the pager layout.
.Ar <value>
is an integer number that may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar 0 Li - Cm SouthWest" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar 0 Li - Cm NorthWest
The starting point is the top left corner.
.It Ar 1 Li - Cm NorthEast
The starting point is the top right corner.
.It Ar 2 Li - Cm SouthEast
The starting point is the bottom right corner.
.It Ar 3 Li - Cm SouthWest
The starting point is the bottom left corner.
.El
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm tags.start Ns Li : Ar 0
.Pp
.Sy Note:
this style element is not yet implemented.  (See
.Pa TODO Ns ).
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm tags. Ns Li { Ns Cm cols Ns Li | Ns Cm rows Ns Li } Ar <number>
Specifies the number of columns or rows (or both) in the pager desktop
layout for the specified screen.  When
.Cm screen<s>
is not specified, applies to all screens.
The default number of rows is two (2).
.Pp
When
.Cm tags.rows
is specified, but not
.Cm tags.cols ,
.Cm tags.cols
will be calculated from
.Cm tags.number
and
.Cm tags.rows .
The same is true when only
.Cm tags.cols
is specified.
When both are specified, the product of the rows and columns must be
greater than the number of workspaces or
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
will reduce
.Cm tags.number
to equal the product.
When specified on their own, rows or columns must be less than the
number of workspaces, or they will be reduced to match.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm tags.rows Ns Li : Ar 2
.Pp
.Sy Note:
this style element is not yet implemented.  (See
.Pa TODO Ns ).
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm deflayout Ar <layout>
Specifies the default layout for views that have no layout defined for
them.
The argument,
.Ar <layout> ,
is a single lowercase ascii character that designates the layout, that
can be one of the following:

.Sy Note:
this style element is not yet implemented.  (See
.Pa TODO Ns ).
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm tags.layout Ns Li [ Ns Cm <n> Ns Li ] Ar <layout>
Specifies the layout for a single view (optionally on a given screen).
When unspecified for a view, defaults to the setting of the
.Cm deflayout
directive (usually floating/stacking).
This is only the default setting for the view at startup: it is
possible to use the key bindings to change the layout for a view.
When
.Cm <n>
is not specified, has the same effect as the
.Cm deflayout
directive.
.Pp
The argument,
.Ar <layout> ,
is a single lowercase ascii character that designates the layout, that
can be one of the following:

.Ss DOCK THEME ELEMENTS
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
has a number of dock theme elements that can be used to theme the dock
that contains Window Maker dock applications.  Theme elements control
the position and orientation of the dock as well as which dock
applications are contained in the dock and in which order.
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Cm dockFile Pa <path>
Specifies the path and filename,
.Pa <path> ,
of a file from which to read dock application theme elements and dock
application ordering.
The path may be absolute or relative: when relative, the path
is considered relative to the directory which contains the
configuration file in which the declaration resides.
The default is
.Pa dockrc ,
that is, the file named
.Pa dockrc
in the same directory as the main configuration file.
.Pp
The
.Pa dockrc
file is normally placed in the same directory as the
.Pa themerc
file to which it corresponds, or included by that file.  When a
.Pa themerc
file is specified, the file will normally specify or include the
.Pa dockFile
file.
.Pp
See
.Xr @PACKAGE@-dock 5
for more information on the format and contents of this file.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dockFile Ns Li : Pa dockrc
.El
.Pp
Because dock theme elements are more thematic, they are usually
contained in a separate
.Pa dockrc
file that is included from the
.Pa themerc
file for a given theme.
See
.Xr @PACKAGE@-dock 5
for more information on the format and contents of this file.
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm hidebastards Ar <number>
Specifies whether to lower bastards, hide bastards (remove struts) or
turn struts off when struts are toggled.  This is only in effect when
struts are disabled.
The
.Ar <number>
value can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar 2 Li - Ic StrutsDown" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar 0 Li - Ic StrutsOff
Turn struts and dock off: marginalize unless selected.
.It Ar 1 Li - Ic StrutsHide
Hide struts and dock (remove from display).
.It Ar 2 Li - Ic StrutsDown
Struts and dock off: lower to bottom unless selected.
.El
.Pp
The default value is zero (0): that is, turn struts off rather
than hiding them.
.Pp
Applications with struts are dock and panel applications that
occupy the edge of the screen.  When struts are on, these
applications occupy their reserved area and the work area on
the screen is reduced.  When struts are off, these
applications occupy the edge of the screen; but, the work area
is not reduced.  When struts are hidden, the work area of the
screen is not reduced; however, the applications owning the
struts are not displayed.
.Pp
This directive affects primarily the response to the
.Cm struts
key binding as described in
.Xr @PACKAGE@-keys 5 .
Setting this value to true has the effect of applying or
removing struts; whereas, the value of false, provides for
exposing and hiding struts.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm hidebastards Ns Li : Ar 2
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm strutsactive Ar <bool>
Specifies whether struts (panels and dock) should default to
shown or hidden.
The
.Ar <bool>
value can be zero (0), indicating false, or non-zero (1),
indicating true.
When true, struts default to shown; false, hidden.
The default value is one (1): that is, struts are shown by default.
.Pp
Default:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm strutsactive Ns Li : Ar 0
.Pp
.Sy Note:
this setting only affects the default for views.  The actual
setting for a particular view can be altered using the
.Cm struts
key binding as described in
.Xr @PACKAGE@-keys 5 .
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.position Ar <position>
Specifies the position of the dock on the screen.
The argument,
.Ar <position> ,
is an integer value that can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar 0 Li - Cm DockSouthWest" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar 0 Li - Cm DockNone
default (same as
.Cm DockEast Ns );
.It Ar 1 Li - Cm DockEast
centered right on the screen;
.It Ar 2 Li - Cm DockNorthEast
top right on the screen;
.It Ar 3 Li - Cm DockNorth
centered top on the screen;
.It Ar 4 Li - Cm DockNorthWest
top left on the screen;
.It Ar 5 Li - Cm DockWest
centered left on the screen;
.It Ar 6 Li - Cm DockSouthWest
bottom left on the screen;
.It Ar 7 Li - Cm DockSouth
centered bottom on the screen;
.It Ar 8 Li - Cm DockSouthEast
bottom right on the screen.
.El
.Pp
The default value is
.Ar 0 Ns , Cm DockNone Ns :
that is, the dock is centered on the right of the screen.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dock.position Ns Li : Ar 0
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.orient Ar <orientation>
Specifies the orientation of the dock on the screen.
The argument,
.Ar "<orientation>" ,
is an integer value that can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar 0 Li - Cm DockVert" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar 0 Li - Cm DockHorz
the dock is filled horizontally;
.It Ar 1 Li - Cm DockVert
the dock is filled vertically.
.El
.Pp
The default value is chosen based on
.Cm "dock.position" ,
and is chosen so that the dock extends along the edge of the
screen.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dock.orient Ns Li : Ar 1
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.monitor Ar <monitor>
Specifies the monitor (in a multi-head setup) that will be
used to contain the dock.  The argument,
.Ar <monitor> ,
is a value between zero (0) and the number of monitors
(inclusive).
.Pp
The special value zero (0) indicates that the
monitor for the dock should be automatically chosen based on
.Cm "dock.position" .
When chosen automatically, the monitor selected for the dock
will be the monitor closest to the dock position on the
screen.
The other values indicate the monitor number of the monitor
that should contain the dock.
When
.Cm screen<s>
is not specified, the same is true for screens as it is for monitors.
.Pp
The default value is zero (0): that is, the dock monitor is
chosen automatically.
.Pp
Example:
.Li Adwm* Ns Cm dock.monitor Ns Li : Ar 0
.It Li [ Ns Cm screen<s>. Ns Li ] Ns Cm dock.app<n> Ar "<res_name> <res_class> <wm_command>"
Specifies the relative position of dock applications in the
dock.
Dock applications with a value of
.Cm <n>
that is lower are placed earlier in the dock; higher, placed
later.
The arguments (separated by a single space) are interpreted as
follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar <wm_command>" -compact -offset indent
.It Ar "<res_name>"
resource name in
.Cm "WM_CLASS"
property;
.It Ar "<res_class>"
resource class in
.Cm "WM_CLASS"
property;
.It Ar "<wm_command>"
command in
.Cm "WM_COMMAND"
property.

.Cm _XROOTPMAP_ID ,
.Cm ESETROOT_PMAP_ID ,
and
.Cm _XSETROOT_ID
properties on the root window as desktops and corresponding backgrounds
change.
It also allocates pixmaps for backgrounds as temporary resources using a
separate X connection to permit other background setters to free the
resource when setting its own background pixmap.

No outstanding bugs.
.Sh HISTORY
.Cm @PACKAGE@
configuration began with the simple X Resource scheme
provided by
.Xr echinus 1
and quickly grew from there to support the advanced features
of
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@ .
The same basic X Resource scheme is supported and an
.Xr echinus 1
resource file will work with
.Nm @PACKAGE_NAME@
(substituting
.Ic Adwm*
for
.Ic Echinus* Ns ).
